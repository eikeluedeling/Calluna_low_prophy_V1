# Calluna support

@CWWhitney The code works but all in all we have to adjust the way of calculating the output. My first approach was focused on profit and now it is about subtracting the outputs of two decisions.
Hope we can speak about how many parameters we have to put in, because it gets very fast very focused on revenue.
An idea would be to focus on healthy plants but also costs of monitoring etc. I have to include.
@marruett this sounds good. There is not really a limit of parameters. Stop before we include the entire universe in the model but we should capture the stakeholders inputs from the qualtiative models and then anything more that we see as necessary. I agree about the idea of making this about more than revenue. Sustainability means more than income so we should capture that here.
