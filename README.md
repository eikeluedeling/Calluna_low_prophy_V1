# Calluna_low_prophy
@CWWhitney I cut the old part away from the model to make it more handy. I fixed the problem of the for loop while using easy multiplications after the "compound interest calculation". We can discuss to check if it is still logical.

To save them: Old parts and equations are still in the code but deactivated while using hashtags.
